# Gourmet S'mores Latte
 

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup of whole milk

- 4 graham crackers, crushed

- 2 tablespoons dark chocolate syrup

- 1 espresso shot or strong brewed coffee

- 2 marshmallows

- Toothpick for toasting marshmallows

 

## Instructions:

 

1. In a saucepan, gently heat the whole milk until it reaches a near-simmer. Add the crushed graham crackers to the milk, allowing them to steep for 10-15 minutes.

 

2. After steeping, strain the infused milk using a cheesecloth or a French press to remove any solid particles, ensuring a smooth and creamy texture.

 

3. Pour the dark chocolate syrup into the bottom of your serving cup, ensuring an even coating.

 

4. Prepare a shot of espresso or brew a strong cup of coffee and pour it over the chocolate syrup in the cup.

 

5. In a separate container, steam the infused graham cracker milk until frothy. Carefully pour the frothed milk over the espresso or coffee in the cup.

 

6. For an extra touch, spear marshmallows onto a toothpick and gently torch them until they are golden brown. Place the toasted marshmallows on top of the latte for a delightful flair.

 

7. Serve immediately and enjoy the rich, indulgent flavors of this gourmet S'mores Latte.
